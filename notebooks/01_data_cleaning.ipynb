Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious Delta variant spreads around the country.\\u201d\",\n          \"Tweet appears to be a right-wing comedian \\\"trolling\\\" the Mayor of Dallas by begging him to mandate vaccines, give free tacos to Latinx people who get vaccinated, hold drag events with free vaccination for the gay community, etc. He also claims he has two children on puberty blockers and those were easier to get than the vaccine. He repeatedly mentions how hard it is for his kids to keep seeing their housekeepers/staff die of Covid. Pretty sure the whole thing was satire and he doesn't actually have kids, but its hard to find concrete information. He is a contributor to Blaze TV and has been a guest on Tucker Carlson's show as well. \",\n          \"This post clearly supports anti-vaccine sentiments. It depicts anti-vaxx protests at the California senate. Due to the emoticons that are used to describe the video, the tweeter doesn't support vaccination. The video displays what it describes as a group of mothers and children banging on the walls, refusing to consent to what they call vaccine mandates. It appears that this posted video may actually be a clip from a protest that took place in September 2019, before the pandemic happened.
